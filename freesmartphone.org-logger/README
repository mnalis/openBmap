openBmap logger version 0.4.1 (22/09/2011)

SUMMARY:
========
OpenBmap is a free and open map of wireless communicating objects
(e.g. cellular antenna, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth). It provides tools to
mutualize data, create and access this map. 
The purpose of this software is to log GSM data, together with
GPS coordinate. This data are sent to the website (www.openbmap.org),
in order to build a free database. In order to keep a high quality
of data, we store GPS quality, speed, GSM signal strength, etc... This
is what makes us different from other similar projects: focus on quality.

This free database will allow research and experimentation about
location algorithms, security, location based services development,
etc.

Possible uses of this database:
* get your location based on the current GSM cell you are connected to.
(GPS needs extra power to function, GSM is always on. Less precise
than GPS, but enough for a lot of usages. Instant location, GPS
needs time to get a fix.)
* speed up GPS first time to fix by providing the location based
on GSM data
* geolocate your photos when taken
* get a map of GSM coverage
* get a map of 2, 2.5, 3G coverage (not yet implemented)
* ...

WHAT'S NEW SINCE 0.3.3?
=======================
* New graphical interface!
* Glade file path not hardcoded anymore.
* Application logging level now in config file.
* Added cells seen statistics.
* Details in CHANGELOG.

WHAT'S NEW SINCE 0.3.2?
=======================
The version number 0.3.3 has been used in logs uploaded to the server.
It was meant as a testing number for version 0.4.0 only.

WHAT'S NEW SINCE 0.3.0?
=======================
(Version 0.3.1 has never been officially released.)
* Debian package.
* Button images do not embed any more text. The text is now a regular
label under the image.
* Button text is now "Start" instead of "Generate".
* rxlev added to serving cell XML log, if available.
* timing advance is available, but deactivated. It needs to be logged
only on specific situation.
* Application logging level set to INFO by default.
* Logging level of some application messages have been changed.
* In a loop, time is now limited to get all data necessary.
* Details in CHANGELOG.

WHAT'S NEW SINCE 0.2.1?
=======================
* Neighbour cells log activated.
* Log files are now much bigger, you should have less files to upload.
* If logs in memory when exiting, they will be written to disk.
* Ignore neighbour cell if lac, cid or rxlev is 0.
* GUI now says: GPS is active, and waiting for 3D fix.
* Fix: GPS time in log is now based on GPS data.
Was using the locale time of the phone.
* When MCC changes, write logs to file.
This means, a log file, only contains data related to a same MCC,
that is to say, to one country.
* Details in CHANGELOG.

WHAT'S NEW SINCE 0.1?
=====================
* The complete process is now done through graphical interface!
* Neighbour cells logging code is present, but deactivated. The
reasons are:
 - we need to clarify the meaning of some fields
 - we need to clarify if there is no risk of mixing cells and
   MCC/MNC at the borders.
* Now displays GSM data at startup. No need to wait for network
  update.
* Before upload, login/password graphical interface added.
* After upload, asks about deleting all processed log files.
* Requests CPU ressource to prevent phone from going to suspend (this
depends on the configuration of the phone...).
* Do not log if a call is ongoing. The reasons are:
 - when in a call org.freesmartphone.GSM.Network.GetStatus()
   returns a lower signal strength.
 - org.freesmartphone.GSM.Monitor.GetNeighbourCellInformation()
   returns garbage when in a call.
* Software id and version added in generated logs

WHAT YOU SHOULD EXPECT:
=======================
* The complete process is done through graphical interface.
* Requests CPU ressource to prevent phone from going to suspend (this
depends on the configuration of the phone...).
* generation of logs (no log during a call).
* logs serving and neighbour cells.
* Graphical window to enter login/password before upload (possibility
to cancel upload).
* upload of logs.
* Graphical window proposing to delete all logs already processed.
* Seen cells (servings / neighbours) counters:
 - total since launch
 - number of cells since last start (gets updated only when logging)

MANUAL:
=======
Interface is straightforward.

Note: The GPS is started as soon as the application is launched.
And it keeps running if the application is logging or not. This
is to prevent losing the GPS position if you pause your logging.
You have to exit the application in order to stop the GPS.

The main window displays data about:
* GSM
* GPS
* GSM statistics
Seen cells (servings / neighbours) counters:
 - total since launch
 - number of cells since last start (gets updated only when logging)

and the status of the logger (running or not). You can find a
menu button which brings a new window.

This menu window is a grid of buttons:

* A button to start generating logs. Values will be displayed when
valid. Logs are stored under HOME/.openBmap/Logs by default.
GPS data is considered valid only when we have a 3D fix.

* A button to stop generating logs.

* A button to upload.
This pops a window up, which displays the current login/password.
Please modify it before pressing 'ok' button if needed. You can
cancel upload by pressing 'cancel'.

If you press 'ok', this will block the interface until every log
has been uploaded. This means that if you do not have Internet
connection up and running, the GUI will be frozen until timeout of
the upload part.

After succesfull upload, the logs are moved to 
HOME/.openBmap/Processed_logs by default.

When upload is finished, the result is first displayed (how many logs
have been uploaded out of how many available).
Then a popup window will propose you to delete all (this includes
possible logs from previous upload) the processed logs (located in
HOME/.openBmap/Processed_logs by default).

Warning: you should create an account on realtimeblog.free.fr
website, and fill a correct login/password in the popup window
displayed before upload works.

* A button to go back to main screen.

* A button to exit (if logger is active, it will first stop it
cleanly, and then exit).

Config file and application log are located under HOME/.openBmap
directory by default.

You can modify values in the config files (by editing it). This
way you can have a fine grained control of your logger:
- change the locations of logs
'openbmap logs directory name', 'openbmap uploaded logs directory name'
- change the rate of logging
openbmap logger default scanning speed (in sec.) = 10
- set a minimal speed for logging
gps minimal speed for logging (km/h) = 0
- set a maximal speed for logging
gps maximal speed for logging (km/h) = 150
- 'openBmap.log' contains the application logs, sets the level of output
application logging level (debug, info, warning, error or critical)
- please do not modify other values, this could prevent the
logger from working correctly.

TROUBLESHOOTING:
================
If you break your configuration file, just exit the application.
Delete the configuration file (by default: HOME/.openBmap/openBmap.conf).
Launch the application. The configuration file, if not found is
generated with default values.

KNOWN BUGS:
===========
* when you are generating logs, and you press 'Stop' button.
  A popup window let you know you should wait for the logger to
  finish stopping. Under FSO M5, if you press the power
  button, the phone suspends. You press it again it wakes up.
  Nevertheless the GUI is frozen. You will have to kill the
  process.
